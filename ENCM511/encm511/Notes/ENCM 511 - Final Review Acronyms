TERMS:
------

	Scheduler	-	Part of TTCOS - It coordinates threads in a queue system. 						Threads can be run periodically or once.
	Semaphore	-	A global variable used to communicate between ISR's and other 						portions of code.
	Waiting		-	An approach that halts processing until waiting is completed 						- sacrificing any other tasks that need to run during that 						time.
	Polling		-	An approach which constantly checks for different conditions, 						but may miss time sensitive information.
	Interrupt	-	An approach which disrupts the regular flow of code to 						prioritize ISR's which must be run now. This allows for 					timely execution of important tasks.	
	Thread		-	A task which is loaded into a scheduler to be run.
	Edge		-	Registers are set when a rising or falling edge is detected 					as opposed to levels.
	Level		-	Registers are set when a level is detected - either active 						high or active low.
