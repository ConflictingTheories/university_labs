% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
The first lab of this course looked at the basics of loading data and displaying it in MATLAB as well as collecting biometric data from a tablet and using it to look at the statistical distributions of different signature variations.
\end{abstract}

% INTRODUCTION
\section{Introduction}
The lab focuses on signatures as the biometric data of interest, and using a WACOM tablet, ten signatures were collected from both group members and an additional five "forged" signatures were also collected from both members.

The data was collected using an application called SigGet whose main function is to collect and convert the measured information from the tablet and convert into an appropriate \textsc{.mat} file. The parameters of interest which were collected included pressure, position, and time information.

These signatures make up the base of the data being analyzed in this laboratory, and upon the completion  of the collecting process, the lab's next focus was on loading and utilizing the collected data within MATLAB's framework.

Once the data is in a convenient format for MATLAB to process it, performing calculations is easily achieved. For the purpose of this lab, the emphasis was on the collecting process and not on complex calculations. A normal distribution was used as the underlying model to compare the collected data and display it.

% PROCEDURE OF THE LAB
\section{Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Using SigGet collect 10 separate sets of signature data from each member. Save and store as individual \textsc{.mat} files.
\item Grab an additional 5 sets of "forged" signatures for use later.
\item Using MATLAB and the guidelines in the lab manual, write a script to display the follow:
\begin{itemize}
\item A colour-coded pressure map of the signature data.
\item A colour-coded velocity map of the signature data.
\item A 3D plot of the signature's pressure map.
\item The normal distributions of the velocity data.
\end{itemize}
\item Discuss any noticeable deviations from the expected outcomes, and give some conclusions on the data observed.
\end{enumerate}

% DISCUSSION
\section{Discussion}
	\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Problem 1 - Issue with Loss of Contact} \\ In order to correct for issues involving a loss of contact, we decided to throw in a conditional check via an If-Statement. Essentially, since MATLAB indexes its information starting with 1, we adjusted the pressure map index value to automatically search for \emph{one (1)} in the event of a \emph{zero (0)}.
    \item \textbf{Problem 2 - Issue with the colour bar} \\ During operation of the lab exercises, we as a group were unable to make MATLAB show its colour bars on any of the figures. This appears to be caused by some sort of path dependency issue as one solution online suggested it may be calling a different version of a built-in function which could be supplying the issue. That or the code needs to be updated to account for the newest features in MATLAB 2015a.
    \item \textbf{Statistical Distributions} \\ After performing an average of the velocity in both the X- and Y- directions, the distributions were analyzed and compared amongst each other. The comparison made apparent the vast difference in the statistical distributions of the different signatures and showcased variations in individual tendencies to write quickly in a particular direction. The distributions did in-fact resemble normal Gaussian distributions and as such our assumption was justified. 
    \item \textbf{Comparison between Real and Forged} \\ Between our two sets of "real" signatures, the distributions were very much different, and upon comparing them to their corresponding "forged" version, they too were also different. This goes to show that statistical analysis would be a sufficient method of comparing and contrasting whilst allowing for variations within the individual signature data.

% CONCLUSIONS
\section{Conclusion/Remarks on the Lab}
	The lab for the most part went off without any problems and the results were as expected. We did run into issues with the colour bars which we were unable to resolve however we did resolve the issue of indexing and loss of contact. Overall, the lab was quite simple and was a nice refresher for MATLAB as well as providing a good starting point into biometric analysis.
