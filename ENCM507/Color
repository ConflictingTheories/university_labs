There exists Three Basis Colour Vectors

	- Red
	- Blue
	- Green

The basis vectors cannot influence each other, merely the relative colour

All colours are made up of combinations of these colour vectors

All colour is relative

Black is the absolute Minimum of the relative colour space - Lowest point of all Vectors

White is the Absolute Maximum of the relative colour space - Highest Point of All Vectors

The sum of the colour space must equal white in relation to the reference

The reference is always black

Colour can neither be created or destroyed, merely compared/contrasted

What colour exists is merely relative to ones position - It is always White in absolute
