	The first topic in our study of mathematics will be arithmetic. While it may seem trivial to include this, 
	many people often take this knowledge for granted, and yet few of us have had a rigorous background in it. 
	At its core, arithmetic is the study of the properties of numbers and their manipulations, i.e. mathematical operations. 
	It forms the basic structure which acts as a framework for almost all of our theories to build off of.

	If you were to ask somebody to explain to you (assuming you had no knowledge of mathematics) how to count, add, subtract and 
	do a variety of other operations, do you think they would find it easy? I would argue that they would have trouble explaining
	it rigorously and concisely. It would be quite similar to asking someone to define a word. Most people understand the 
	correct context in which to use the word, but many have huge difficulties in defining it. The inherent difficulties most likely 
	arise from having to define it in a very general case. This requires the person to have knowledge of other words and not only
	that, but also to be able to explain the concept without referencing the original word itself. Just as using a word and defining 
	a word are two very different actions, so too is performing arithmetic and understanding arithmetic.

	<span>Numbers</span>
	<br /><br />
	What are numbers? For our purposes, a number is a mathematical object which represents a quantity or an amount. A number can be seen
	as an abstraction of the world around us. We define their properties and laws, give them labels, and by doing so, we
	are able to evaluate, compare, and utilize them. Similarly, consider that although apples existed without us, we were required to label
	and define them in order for us to be able make references about them. Now, do not confuse numbers with numerals. Numerals are symbols which 
	are used to represent numbers and provide us with a method of writing them down. While you may wish to call a numeral a number, this is 
	not correct.
	<br /><br />
	What do you mean we define their properties and laws? Numbers are constant and absolute...aren't they? You might be 
	wondering what I meant by this. Before I explain, let me tell a small story about the number zero. Although it might seem a little
	strange, the first number systems known to have been used by humans did not include a representation for zero. In fact it would be
	thousands of years longer before any system of numbers included it. The reason for this might have been due to the fact that prior
	to the use of it, numbers were mainly used to count items, populations, days, etc. If something was not present, they would probably
	have either not included it in their lists, or would have written explicitly what had happened(eaten, burned, destroyed, lost, stolen, etc.)
	This special number was quite controversial, and some cultures were unsure whether it was possible to have something which
	represented nothing. Another interesting tangent to this story, is that negative numbers were also not represented for thousands of
	years. Since it was mainly the use of counting in which numbers were employed, it was not necessary to include negative numbers as
	they did not encounter situations in which a removal of items resulted in a negative amount. The idea of negative amounts is purely a philosophical tool
	that we have applied to a numerous applications in order to better explain and expand different theories and postulations.
	So back to my previous statement regarding our definition of numbers. While it is obvious that there exists a physical representation
	of an amount whether it be three apples, two bicycles, or one Sun, these empirical observations cannot provide us with
	the ability to extrapolate or interpret. Their existence only provides a truth. This is where the creation of numbers comes in handy.
	<br /><br />
	We as humans saw the world around us, and began to notice that there were greater amounts of some things and less of others. At first
	we didn't think much of this, it was just a fact taken at face value with nothing more hidden beneath the exterior, but soon, as we
	began to evolve and advance in our civilization we found a need to pay attention to these discrepencies. At first it might have been
	a want or need to record the number of days past since the moon was full, or the number of meals eaten by different members of the tribe.
	Tallies were used and the first records we kept. Continuing along we found a need not just to document what had happened or past, but what
	was present and possibly what was needed. As this happened, record keeping began to expand to all sorts of things. The first basic understanding
	of numbers had happened. While they might have only been etches on a stick or bone, they represented the first step towards what we have today.
	A need for a more efficient method was needed, as tallies take up space and unfortunately do not provide a very effective method by which we can 
	quickly recount them. This difficiency was surely the motivation behind new systems of numbers. In Mesopotamia, the Hexegesimal number system 
	was used. Unlike our common decimal system which has a base of 10, the Hexegesimal system had a base of 60. Over the ages many different 
	cultures have used different number systems, and a few are used today. Decimal is the most common, and it comes naturally to us, as humans 
	usually have 10 fingers and 10 toes. In other specializations, different systems are used (Binary, Octal, Hexedecimal) as they each have 
	their own benefits and problems. 
	<br /><br />
	Although this seems quite pointless, it goes to show that our perception on numbers is taken most often for granted. Numbers are a human
	invention which was created so that we could better understand and interpret what we saw. It started with counting, but as you are most
	likely aware, it has come to provide us with almost unlimited possibilities, and every day, new uses and information is gleaned from them.
